# sketchup-mouse-remapper
Remap Sketchup default key for orbit &amp; pan with middle mouse button

This solution works on **only windows** and **only in Sketchup**.

|  Action  |  Before (sketchup default)  | After running script |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|  Orbit  |  middle mouse  |  alt + middle mouse  |
|  Pan  |  shift + middle mouse  |  middle mouse  |

if you don't want to change the keystrokes or script, just download "3ds_max_keystrokes.exe" file and run it on your windows.  
After running script (wether .exe or .ahk version) an "H" icon will be added to your taskbar:

For pausing/existing the script, just right click on "H" icon in taskbar and choose "Pause Script"/"Exit":  
If you exit the script, you should re-run the file for activating remmaping.

If you want to change, develope or access to script code download "Sketch_mouse_remapper.ahk".
You'll need [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) for running the script.
